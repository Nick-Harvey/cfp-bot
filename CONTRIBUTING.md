# Contribute to CFP-Bot

### So you want to contribute?

**GREAT!!! :smile:** We love when people get like us and want to help
out the world around them. Your experiences will benefit others who
come across this repository!

### Ground rules
Before you start coding your heart out, let's make sure to remind you what
the community surrounded by this repo expects:

- Be kind and thoughtful with your conversations. We are all from different backgrounds
and projects, and as such we more than likely do not think the same way about
how we may accomplish a task. Listen to others and understand them rather than
convincing them that your way is the "correct" or "only" way.
- We also follow our own [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### How to Contribute

We accept both [Pull Requests](https://github.com/maxcell/cfp-bot/pulls) and
[Issues](https://github.com/maxcell/cfp-bot/issues). Issues can be used as a
method for you to open a discussion on how we improve the repository, note
a bug that exists within our project, or request a new feed to be added. The
only thing is that we encourage that you add your own feeds. We would love to
give you feedback about your implementation, but as time and resources come along
it may be challenging. Never feel as though you cannot reach out to the maintainers!
We are always kind and thoughtful.
